//! The memory of one workspace on disk (PRD jev-mem §6): `<state-dir>/memory/<workspace_id>/`,
//! outside the repository, 0700 and 0600. A generation is published whole, through a private
//! temporary, `sync_all`, `rename` and a sync of the directory, so a reader sees the previous
//! generation or the new one and a power loss keeps one of them. What cannot be read is
//! unavailable and is never overwritten: it may be a newer schema or evidence of a fault.
//!
//! Observations arrive in a spool of immutable files, one per node, written without a lock so a
//! hook never waits. One writer at a time incorporates them into a new generation and only then
//! removes them: a crash in between replays the spool, and a replay is the same node. A hook
//! does not force its spool file to disk either (D-174): the generation that takes it in is
//! forced, and a file a power loss left empty is rejected and removed.
